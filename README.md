# Pasts
Minimal and simpler alternative to the futures crate.

- No required std
- No allocations
- No procedural macros (for faster compile times)
- No dependencies
- No cost (True zero-cost abstractions!)
- No pain (API super easy to learn & use!)
- No unsafe code in pinning macro (allowing you to `forbid(unsafe_code)`)
